2D game worked on in Game Dev course

Project worked on Spring 2016 by 4-person team, including myself.
I handled the majority of the player movement, enemy AI, collision and interaction of enemy/player.

Objective: Survive enemy waves, avoid falling, and get through the boss "fight".  
Current status: Unfinished. Missing some animations, level expansion, and boss area.

Controls:  
A - move left  
D - move right  
Space - jump  
left/right arrow keys - spin attack  
up arrow key - up attack  
down arrow key - down attack
